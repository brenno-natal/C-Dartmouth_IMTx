/bin
This is the directory which contains all of the basic commands needed
to start and use a minimal system.
The directory name is derived from the abbreviation of binary.
The executable file of an application is called a binary.

/sbin
This directory contains commands--
executable, so binaries-- for the super user, also called root user.
The root user is the administrator of the computer
and has more powers than simple users.

/home
Home contains all of user directories-- for example,
/home/smith or /home/brenno for me.

/root
This is the home directory of the root user,
the user that has the 'superpowers'.

/etc
This directory contains configuration files.
In fact, it is the abbreviation of Editable Text Configuration.

/lib
Where the system stores software libraries required for executables
in /bin and /sbin

/tmp
This directory is for temporary files.
Sometimes, it is located in /var/tmp or /run/tmp
It is usually emptied every time you restart the computer.

/var
This contains various files used by the operating system, such as databases,
email boxes, and history.
A log of what happened on the system is in /var/logs, for example.

/usr
USR is the acronym of Unix System Resources,
and not user, as one might think.
This folder contains some subfolders, similar to those present
that the roots, but they are used to extend the system operations.
For example, this folder includes /usr/bin
That contains executable binaries that are not already present in /bin
and, therefore, not essential to a minimal system.
Or /usr/lib that contains those libraries that are not essential
for a minimal system.

/dev
This directory contains files, each of which
corresponds, directly or indirectly, to a physical device.
dev is a decent abbreviation for device.
This is one of the strengths of Linux.
It considers everything as a file, including devices,
such as /dev/printer, /dev/audio, /dev/mem for memory, /dev/networkcard,
and so forth.
